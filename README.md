# Battleship

This is the classic game of battleship, writtin in TypeScript. It follows object-oriented design patterns.

## How To Run

The project must be compiled before running, and the dist directory is not checked into git. To run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will compile the TypeScript into JavaScript into a `dist/` directory, and it will run the code with `nodemon`.
